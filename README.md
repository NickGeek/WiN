WiN
===

WiN (Wireless Inter-Home Network) is designed to do what crowd-funding did for projects but for mobile networks. Uses of this could be in businesses to replace wired phone extensions, communications when cellular towers and the Internet is down or in place of a pager at a hospital. It could even be used to call your son to dinner! It doesn't require an Internet connection or traditional cellular coverage so it can be completely free.
